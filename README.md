## My Process
- This time I created a single page application (SPA) with the help of React Router. It consumes data from an API and generates a card for every country dynamically. The page has a search bar, a dropdown menu to filter by region and a dark mode toggled by a button.
- When the flag of a country is clicked, it redirects to another page with more information.
- Instead of props, I handled most of the data with Context API because of the complexity.
